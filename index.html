          <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
          laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
          returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
          pest-resistent plants.
        </li>

          leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
          plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
          different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
          varieties for each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        
        <br />

        <li>
          <strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
          with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
          well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        
        <br />
        
        <li>

          increase their maize and sorghum yields
        </li>

        <br />
        
        <li>
          <strong>2005</strong> - States "we will have to double the world food
          supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only
          way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
          crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
          modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
          science, people were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <br />
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
